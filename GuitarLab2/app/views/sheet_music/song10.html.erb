[Intro]

G Am Em C
G Am Em C


[Verse]

G                       Am
Remember those walls I built
                           Em
Well baby they're tumbling down
                              C
And they didn't even put up a fight
                              G
They didn't even make a sound
                         Am
I found a way to let you in
                         Em
But I never really had a doubt
                              C
Standing in the light of your halo
                  G
I got my angel now
                           Am
It's like I've been awakened
                           Em
Every rule I had you breakin'
                              C
It's the risk that I'm takin'
                              G
I ain't never gonna shut you out


[Pre-Chorus]

G                       Am
Everywhere I'm looking now
                           Em
I'm surrounded by your embrace
                              C
Baby I can see your halo
                              G
You know you're my saving grace
                         Am
You're everything I need and more
                           Em
It's written all over your face
                              C
Baby I can feel your halo
                              G
Pray it won't fade away


[Chorus]

                         Am
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                           Em
I can see your halo (halo) halo
                              C
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                              G
I can see your halo (halo) halo
G
Woah...


[Verse]

                        Am
Hit me like a ray of sun
                           Em
Burning through my darkest night
                              C
You're the only one that I want
                              G
Think I'm addicted to your light
                        Am
I swore I'd never fall again
                           Em
But this don't even feel like falling
                              C
Gravity can't forget
                              G
To pull me to the ground again
                        Am
Feels like I've been awakened
                           Em
Every rule I had you breakin'
                              C
The risk that I'm takin'
                              G
I'm never gonna shut you out


[Pre-Chorus]

G                       Am
Everywhere I'm looking now
                           Em
I'm surrounded by your embrace
                       C
Baby I can see your halo
                              G
You know you're my saving grace
                         Am
You're everything I need and more
                           Em
It's written all over your face
                       C
Baby I can feel your halo
                       G
Pray it won't fade away


[Chorus]

                         Am
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                           Em
I can see your halo (halo) halo
                              C
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                              G
I can see your halo (halo) halo
                         Am
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                           Em
I can see your halo (halo) halo
               C
Halooooo ouuuu
               G
Halooooo ouuuu
              Am
Halooooo ouuuu
           Em    C     G
Ouuuuu ouuuuu ouuuuu


[Pre-Chorus]

G                       Am
Everywhere I'm looking now
                           Em
I'm surrounded by your embrace
                     C
Baby I can see your halo
                              G
You know you're my saving grace
                         Am
You're everything I need and more
                           Em
It's written all over your face
                       C
Baby I can feel your halo
                     G
Pray it won't fade away


[Chorus]

                         Am
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                           Em
I can see your halo (halo) halo
                              C
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                              G
I can see your halo (halo) halo
                         Am
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                           Em
I can see your halo (halo) halo
                              C
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                              G
I can see your halo (halo) halo
